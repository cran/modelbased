# modelbased 0.3.0

## Breaking changes

- `Predicted` is now the name of the predicted column for Bayesian models (similarly to Frequentist ones), instead of the centrality index (e.g., `Median`).

## New supported models

- Models from package *glmmTMB* are now supported.

## Bug fixes

- `estimate_slope()` now gives an informative error when no numeric predictor is present.

# modelbased 0.2.0

- Partial support of formulas.
- Refactor the emmeans wrapping.

# modelbased 0.1.3

- Fix CRAN check issues.

# modelbased 0.1.2

- Minor code changes to address changes from the forthcoming `parameters` package update.

# modelbased 0.1.1
